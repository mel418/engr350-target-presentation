      While personalization can enhance customer satisfaction, companies like Target must ensure it does not come at the expense of consumer privacy, striking a delicate balance. <br />
      Target's ability to predict sensitive information like pregnancy based on consumer data underscores the potential invasion of privacy and the need for ethical considerations. <br />
      Target's extensive data collection practices, such as assigning unique Guest IDs to track purchases, raise concerns about consumer privacy despite being within legal boundaries. <br />
      Companies like Target must prioritize ethical data practices to safeguard consumer rights and maintain trust in an increasingly data-driven world.
